var o = {f: function() { return this.a + this.b; }};
var p = Object.create(o);
p.a = 1;
p.b = 4;

console.log(p.f()); // 5
---------------------------------------------
1)the object assigned to the variable p doesn't have its own f property, it inherits it from its prototype
2)it doesn't matter that the lookup for f eventually finds a member with that name on o;
3)the lookup began as a reference to p.f, so this inside the function takes the value of the object referred to as p
